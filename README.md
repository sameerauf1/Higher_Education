## Student Sucess in Higher Education

Predicting Student Dropout and Academic Success

## Overview

This project aims to predict student dropout and academic success in higher education, focusing on STEM fields. A machine learning model was developed using early academic performance and socioeconomic factors. The Random Forest model achieved over 90% test set accuracy.

## Prerequisites

- Python (>= 3.x)
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, sklearn, matplotlib, scipy

## Usage

1. Clone the repository.

2. Upload the dataset.

3. Run the Python script.

## Workflow

1. Data Loading and Preprocessing: The dataset is loaded and cleaned
2. Model Training (Random Forest): A Random Forest classifier is trained on the data.
3. Model Evaluation
- Accuracy: The model's accuracy is calculated
- Confusion Matrix: A confusion matrix is generated to visualize model performance.
- ROC Curve: Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve is plotted to assess the model's ability to distinguish between classes
5. Additional Analyses (Gender and Scholarship).

## Results

The model successfully predicts student success and dropout, offering early intervention opportunities to improve academic outcomes.

## Python Libraries

The project relies on several Python libraries for its implementation:

- **pandas:** Used for data manipulation and cleaning.
- **numpy:** Utilized for numerical operations and array manipulation.
- **scikit-learn:** Provides machine learning tools and algorithms.
- **matplotlib:** Used for data visualization and generating plots.
- **scipy:** Employed for statistical analyses and tests.
